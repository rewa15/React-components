# React-components
Created with CodeSandbox

1. It is a simple react assignment for React Beginners.
2. It allows us to create different react components into different .jsx files, and defining components in them, and then importing them into 
   our main App.js file.
3. When we make individual react components in jsx files, we need to import React from "react" each time.
